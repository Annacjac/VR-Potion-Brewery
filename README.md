# VR Potion Brewery
Step into the enchanting world of "Potion Brewmaster VR," (working title) a captivating virtual reality experience where you take on the role of a skilled witch, mastering the art of potion-making in a charming cottage nestled in a small village. Gather a variety of magical herbs, ingredients, and mystical items to fulfil potion orders for your neighbors.

# About the Game
Potion Brewmaster VR is an early development Unreal Engine 5 project created by me, Anna Jacobson (with the help of the creators of the assets I used). A demo will be released soon that will include a comprehensive tutorial to guide you through the basics of potion making and three unique potion orders that you can fulfill using five herbs that will be provided for you.

# Demo Features
- Tutorial: Learn the fundamentals of potion making, from ingredient preparation to brewing techniques.
- Three Potion Orders: Put your skills to the test by fulfilling potion orders with the given ingredients.
- Interactive Environment: Explore your cozy witch's cottage, complete with potion-making tools, shelves for storing ingredients, and a cauldron over a roaring fire.

# Future Developments
After the release of the demo, I hope to continue development towards a full version of the game, with many more features and gameplay elements:
- Herb Garden: Grow your own herbs in a magical garden, nurturing plants to harvest fresh ingredients for your potions.
- Enchanted Forest: Venture into a mystical forest to forage for rare and powerful ingredients that can't be found in shops.
- Magic Wand: Cast a variety of helpful spells to aid in your resource gathering and everyday activities.
- Village Interaction: Get to know the villagers, build relationships, and buy ingredients and equipment from local shops. Your interactions with the villagers will influence your reputation and the resources available to you.
- Crystal Ball: Use a crystal ball to predict the weather for the next day, which will affect the availability of rare ingredients in the forest. Plan your foraging trips accordingly to make the most of your adventures.
- Morality System: As you progress further into the game, you'll encounter a morality system that lets you choose between fulfilling helpful potion requests or malicious ones. Your choices will lead you down different moral paths, influencing your reputation and the overall narrative of your journey.


As I continue to develop Potion Brewmaster, I am excited to bring you a magical and immersive experience that combines potion crafting with exploration and interaction. Stay tuned for updates and the upcoming demo release, where you'll get a first taste of the enchanting world we're creating. In the mean time, feel free to check out the project in its current state.
